            <p>My name is Declan. My interests mainly consist of gaming, <em>anime</em>, video editing, and of course graphics related stuff. I’ve been in college prior to this, but I was incredibly unhappy with quite literally everything about where I was living and the school I was attending. I ended up moving back to Ottawa, which is where I'm originally from, and am now in this program.</p>
            <p>I also have quite a large interest in a certain vocaloid character, her name is Hatsune Miku<sup>TM</sup>. If I were to attend any concert, I’d choose a Hatsune Miku concert first. I wish I owned any of her figurines, but they are sometimes upwards of $300; and, I don’t have that kind of money at the moment. I even have a social media page sort of based on Miku to an extent, so yeah I really like Hatsune Miku.</p>
            <h4>Motivational Quote</h4>
            <q>Do you hear the baby stars? These newborns will grow up to become galaxies someday. When stars die, they turn to stardust and scatter across the cosmos. Eventually, that stardust reforms to create a new star... And so the cycle of life continues. But the cycle never repeats itself in quite the same way.... So...you'll see."
